    <h3>GORILLA</h3>    
    <p>Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, either four or five subspecies. The dna of gorillas is highly simalar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included and they are next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and baboons.</p> 
        <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, weights between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, withthe leader being called silverback. The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by darker fur colorand some other minor morphologial differences.</p>
