    <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>    
    <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family of Elephantidae and the order proboscedia. TWo species are traditionally recognised, the african elephant (Loxodonta africana) and Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some suggest that African bush elephant and African forest elephant are separate species (L. Africana and L.cyclotis). Elephants are scarttered throughout sub-suharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order proboscedia; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphothers, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reath a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>  
    <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or probiscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their insors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ears flaps helps to control their body temparature. Their pillar-like legs  can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs</p> <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitants including savanna, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near the water.</p>
